# Chernarus-Cold-War

Custom Antistasi Plus edit; based on not changing actual codebase, only adjusting within given boundaries.

Main changes:

- heavily expanded music script (uses music from A3, CUP, VN, GM -> need to add dependecies selector)
- custom VN + GM faction, with working logistics nodes and everything else
- custom crates for vehicle spawning and arsenal
- expanded placeable buildings, allowing players to set up a camp
- modified all 2035 assets on the chernarus map to better autehticity (removed Large towers, replaced with Tower bunkers)
- disabled simulation or enabled dynamic simulation on preplaced assets in scenario to gain better performance
- slowed movement speed of all spawned patrols -> FIXED the "jerky" movement speed that could be observed before
- lowered the price of loot crate & rally point in order to make the mission easier for low player numbers (we play w/ 1-3 players)

All these changes were done with minimal impact to scenario codebase.

To Do:
- create the GM + VN faction as an independent faction (for cleanliness sake)
- test in nighttime -> do I need to add flare guns to more loadouts
- port to other map versions
- allow SOME minor buildings under concrete bunkers
